	<div class="image"></div>
	<div class="text">Hello! My name is Kelsey. I am currently a sophomore at Hunter College majoring in Media Studies and minoring in Computer studies. I use my Wacom tablet to create digital illustrations(hence the illustration on the homepage). My illustrations mostly feature original characters. I love designing them and developing their characters through my drawings. Besides that, I have a general interest in using technology to do creative things.
